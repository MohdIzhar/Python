Implementing Collection using TDD - Test Driven Development approach.

Container - in , not in 
Sized
Iterable
Sequence
Set - various set operation intersection, union, etc

Lets build SortedSet Collection that Implements all these 5 protocols that have distinct element and constructible from an element.

Two files:
    test_sorted_set.py
    sorted_set.py

Testing iterable with generator is best way.
